                <h3> Nomadic? Rover by Days Singing These Gang Plank Songs of the Ambler </h3>
                <p> Reflects the intense and unguarded energy of a vital artist and natural storyteller who has deep connections to both historic and current movements. His subject matter ranges from childhood memories of racial inequality to contemporary ideas of gender fluidity, and his absurd ditties tickle the what the fuck bone in all of us. </p>

                <h3> Tiny Chasm </h3>
                <p> Explores the miniscule openings in our psyches in order to reveal the vast infrastructures of our neuroses, anxieties, and joys. It ponders the responsibilities of self to child and society; the ways we are manipulated and conditioned; the struggles of loss and longing; as well as the pathways into awareness and being present. </p>

            <h3> Finishing Touches  </h3>
            <p> The old, represented by Teeming Americana, has its logic in history and opens itself to dramatization 
                while the new, Station Crossings, tends more towards philosophical gatherings and the quests and the
                 needs of character types. The line of difference is marked by the first of the new poems, where reality of 
                 events seems to contradict the mythography of poetry. </p>

            <h3>  Undiscovered Paladins </h3>
            <p>  Undiscovered Paladins: Westward Rhymes Revisited emerges in the present but never overlooks (nor fails to 
                consider) the intertwined nature of its fleeting past and immutable future, which courtesy of current technologies 
                are now etched together on the Internet for electronic eternity. It embodies the spirit of existentialism, prospecting 
                everyday life west of the Mississippi for an authentic American Dream while simultaneously chronicling the absurdity of 
                the American Reality: being human in the twenty-first century. </p>

                 then proceeds to compare the nature of these anti-gods with Satan, Esau, Sisyphus, Iago, 
                 and Goneril (from King Lear) </p>

            <p> Effortlessly weaves her spirituality, Black consciousness, and femininity into a tapestry of fully poetic words that are part memoir, part Black Studies thesis, part feminist manifesto, and part sacred text. </p>

        <h3>  Hypnotizing Lines </h3>
        <p> In August 2010, j.d.tulloch and his reliable traveling companion,
             a 1997 Lincoln Town Car, embarked on what has evolved into a fifty-thousand-plus mile journey, 
             trekking westward--and then eastward--on a noble quest of inspiration, an escapade of adventure, 
             in search of an American Dream that once hearkened the spirits of forgotten voyagers who beckoned
              him from afar as Horace Greeley loudly whispered in his ear, "Go west, young man ... Go west. </p>
    </div>

  
    <div class="books-col"> 
        <img src="Poetry Books/poetry6.jpeg" > 
       
        <h3> Through the Years </h3>
        <p> Philosophical, or deeply psychological, "Why Do Grown Men Weep?" and "The American Writer," while others border on the religious: "Desert Bloom" and "Oil and Water." 
            The volume contains new sections called "Wallet Poems"--poems dealing with day-to-day subjects that are meant to be carried with you.
            Mr. Quinones' poems skillfully vary in their reflectiveness, ultimately making the collection practically impossible to summarize. </p>

    <div class="books-col"> 
        <img src="Poetry Books/poetry3.jpeg" > 
       
        <h3> A Sorting of the Ways</h3>
        <p>In the poem "A New Beginning," Quinones takes the gamble of expressing his own philosophical and moral 
            desideratum as to the nature of art and society, thus enacting his belief that at sometime a writer-poet
             must come to grips with those things he thinks essential if a society is to be reborn. </p>
