          <h2>Submission Guide Lines for 2023</h2>
          <p>
            39 West Press is an independent publisher of art, humor, literary
            fiction, creative non-fiction, and poetry books. Read and follow
            these guidelines or your submission will be rejected. <br />
            <br />

            Our submission guidelines have changed. Please make note of the new
            guidelines. If you do not read and follow these simple guidelines,
            your submission will be rejected without notice.
            <br />
            <br />

            General Information <br />
            <br />
            39 West Press publishes books of art, humor, literary fiction,
            creative non-fiction, and poetry. Our desire is to promote and
            publish a diverse range of experiences and voices, including but not
            limited to people of color, gender diversity, people with
            disabilities, LGBTQIA, as well as ethnic and cultural minorities.

            <br />
            <br />

            We accept unsolicited manuscripts for books of literary fiction,
            creative non-fiction, and full-length poetry volumes (at least fifty
            pages or more). We are looking for innovative and well-crafted,
            high-quality works by new and established authors. Additionally, we
            are interested in authors who have strong platforms and are able to
            connect with their audiences via direct engagement, whether it be an
            email newsletter, a blog, a podcast, social media, etc.
            <br />
            <br />

            We are NOT looking for unsolicited submissions in the following
            categories: genre fiction (romance, erotica, science fiction,
            horror, true crime, mystery, etc.), cookbooks, how-to books,
            self-help books, memoirs, autobiographies, political manifestos,
            philosophical diatribes, or religious inspirational books. Please do
            not send self-published or previously published manuscripts. We are
            not looking for single stories, essays, or poems at this time.
            <br />
            <br />

            To ensure that 39 West Press is the proper fit for your manuscript,
            please familiarize yourself with our authors and catalogue prior to
            submitting. <br />
            <br />
            <br />

            Submission Guidelines <br />
            <br />
            Your submission must include two separate items: (1) a cover letter,
            and (2) your manuscript.

            <br />
            <br />

            (1) Your cover letter should be formatted in a similar manner as
            this sample and must include the title of your work, the genre of
            your work, a brief description of your work, and your author bio.
            Submissions lacking any of these elements will be rejected. Optional
            information that may give your manuscript an advantage over other,
            comparable manuscripts: Please discuss your author platform, its
            scope, and ways in which you expect to reach potential reviewers and
            readers. Please provide links to your website, blog, podcast, social
            media, etc. Also, if you have access to special markets, audiences,
            or promotional opportunities for your book, then we would like to
            know about them. Note: It is acceptable to place your cover letter
            in the body of the submission email. <br />
            <br />

            ( 2) Your manuscript should be sent as an email attachment in one of
            the following electronic file formats: .doc, .docx, .pdf, or .odt.
            No other file formats will be accepted. However, if your submission
            is over 5MB, please upload it to a file-sharing site and provide us
            with the link to your work. Please do not paste your work into the
            body of the submission email; it will not be read. We do not accept
            snail-mailed hard copies of your manuscript. Note: Prior to
            submitting, make sure that your manuscript has been well-edited,
            proofread, and is in a legible font. <br />
            <br />

            Simultaneous Submissions <br />
            <br />
            Simultaneous submissions to other publishers are permissible.
            However, do not send us a mass forward that you are submitting to
            multiple publishers at once; your manuscript will be rejected. If
            other publishers are also considering your work, then please let us
            know. Do not submit more than one manuscript at a time unless we
            have solicited your work. <br />
            <br />

            Where to Submit <br />
            <br />
            Email your submission to submit(AT)39West(DOT)Press. In the subject
            line, please place the word Submission followed by the title of your
            work. An auto-generated email will be sent to you to confirm receipt
            of your submission. If you do not follow our simple, submission
            guidelines, your manuscript will be rejected without notice. We look
            forward to reading your work and appreciate your interest in 39 West
            Press. <br />
            <br />

            respond personally to every query nor provide critiques of rejected
            manuscripts. If we have interest in your work, then you will be
            contacted within ninety (90) of its receipt. <br />
